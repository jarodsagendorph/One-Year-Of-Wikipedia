# One Year Of Wikipedia
The perfect (free) gift for someone who has everything! A year of ad-free access to Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia. Subscription renews annually automatically.

## TODO: Design and print "gift card" with QR "redemption" code

### QR code should open a TODO: static webpage talking about how cool Wikipedia is (which obviously links Wikipedia and the Wikimedia foundation)

## TODO: Make email "gift card" template 

## TODO: Make a donation (about $3/card handed out) to the Wikimedia Foundation (which is just about the amount it costs to run Wikipedia per person per year, according to Wikipedia...). Unrelated to the cards, Wikipedia is just really cool :)
